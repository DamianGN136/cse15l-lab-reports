This lab report will be a tutorial on remote access. This process will be divided into 3 steps:  
      1. Installing VScode  
      2. Remotely Connecting  
      3. Trying some commands after remotely connecting  
      
---  
Step 1: Installing VScode  

In order to connect remotely, you are going to need VSCode. Use this link top download:
      [Link](https://code.visualstudio.com/)  
      
Now, if you're on Windows, click on the blue botton that says: **Download for Windows** (stable build)  
It should look like this:

Once you click on the download button, the download will appear somewhere on your browser (In my case its at the bottom)  

Click on it and set up VSCode

*Note*: if you are on Mac, you are going to want to click on the drop down for the Windows download button and select the MacOS stable build option:
